Create a Shopping Cart System using React Native Expo. Implement proper navigation between screens and context API (for cleaner code).

Requirements:
- There should be 3 screens: Home, Cart, and Checkout

- The Home Screen contains all the available products. It must also display the product details (e.g. Product Name and Product Price). 
    There must also be an 'Add to Cart' button beside each product. A 'Go to Cart' button must also be available within the screen. 

- The Cart Screen contains all the added products to the cart. There must be a '+' and '-' button beside each product that has
    a functionality of adding or reducing/removing product quantity. The item price must also update accordingly.
    
- The Checkout Screen contains all the products that have been added to the cart and is for checkout. The correct item prices
    and total price must be displayed along with the product name. A 'Checkout' button must also be available within the screen.
    Clicking the 'Checkout' button will display an alert or pop-up that says, 'Checkout successful'. Clicking 'OK' on the alert
    or pop-up will redirect the user to the Home Screen.
